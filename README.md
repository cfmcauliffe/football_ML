This respository will be used for analyzing the College Football Team Stats Seasons 2013 - 2020 (https://www.kaggle.com/jeffgallini/college-football-team-stats-2019?select=cfb13.csv). We plan to clean and merge the datasets and then find key columns that have a high correlation with their rankings. To scope this project down we plan on using the Big10 and SEC divisions. 

Our proposal doc gives an early outline of this data, please note we have added the step of creating a machine learning model to predict rankings.

**In progress, not yet complete will be finished and uploaded by Dec. 2, 2021**
